# The Ulimate List of HTML to PDF APIs

This list aims to be the ultimate list of HTML to PDF APIs. We have curated this list of the best HTML to PDF APIs based on their ease of use, documentation, and pricing. We also use the community votes from [APIFinder](https://apifinder.com/category/html-or-url-to-pdf) for the ranking.

### Comparing the Pricing

Some APIs are charging based on the amount of PDFs created while others are also charing based on the size of the PDF that has been created. When an API is charging based on the size of the PDF, we have calculated the price based on a PDF of 2MB in size. We feel like thats a reasonable size for the average PDF.

**Playground**: [Open Playground](https://pdfendpoint.com/playground)
> The playground allows you to test the API without having to sign up for free. We think this is the best playground in this list so be sure to give it a try!

**Pricing**: *Monthly Subscription* - [Pricing Page](https://pdfendpoint.com/pricing)
> Pricing is based on the number of PDFs you generate per month with no file size limit. You can generate an unlimited number of PDFs per month since all plans have the option for overusage so you do not get limited if you have reached your monthly quota.
